# XFCE4-WSL-Ubuntu
Before installing XFCE4
Run `/etc/init.d/dbus` start in your WSL-Ubuntu session
Then do `sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop`

At this point you just have to create a shortcut of XUbuntu-WSL1.bat or XUbuntu-WSL2.bat on your desktop and you are reading to go.
If you want you can change the icon by whatever you want in the shortcut properties
